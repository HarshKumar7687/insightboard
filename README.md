# 📊 InsightBoard – Web-Based Business Analytics Dashboard

🚀 [Live Demo](https://tata-insightboard.netlify.app/)

## 📌 Project Overview
**InsightBoard** is a full-stack business analytics dashboard built during my internship at **Tata Motors**.  
It allows users to upload CSV datasets, visualize data using interactive charts, apply filters, and export analytical reports – all from a clean, responsive web interface.  

The project bridges the gap between complex enterprise tools (like Tableau/Power BI) and lightweight, accessible web applications.
